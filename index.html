    <h3>Blog Post: Cisco ACI Data Center Design</h3>
    <img class="blog-image" src="cisco-aci-fabric-diagram.png" alt="Cisco ACI Diagram">
    <p><strong>The Core – Cisco ACI Fabric</strong><br>
    At the center of this topology lies the Cisco ACI fabric, formed by a spine-leaf architecture. Two Nexus 9332C switches serve as spines, and two Nexus 9336-FX2 switches act as leafs. These are interconnected via 40GbE links, ensuring a non-blocking, low-latency fabric. All devices connect only to the leaf layer for scalable, predictable networking.</p>
    <p><strong>Policy Control – ACI APIC Cluster</strong><br>
    A cluster of APIC controllers connects to the leaf switches to push policies, manage configuration, monitor performance, and enforce security—all through an application-centric model that simplifies operations.</p>
    <p><strong>External Connectivity – Management and Outside Networks</strong><br>
    A Management Switch connects to the ACI leafs via vPC links, enabling integration with outside networks and seamless VLAN extension for migrations or legacy systems.</p>
    <p><strong>Compute Domain – Cisco UCS with Fabric Interconnects</strong><br>
    Cisco UCS 6454 Fabric Interconnects link the ACI leafs to compute nodes via high-speed connections, providing end-to-end automation, server policy management, and fabric-based failover for mission-critical SAP workloads.</p>
    <p><strong>Storage Domain – NetApp AFF A300</strong><br>
    The NetApp AFF A300 connects to the ACI leafs using 40GbE Port-Channels to deliver low-latency access for NFS, iSCSI, or FCoE traffic, with consistent security and QoS policies applied through the fabric.</p>

    <h3>Blog Post: AI Is Now Growing Faster Than Data Centers Can Handle</h3>
    <img class="blog-image" src="ai-data-center-boom.png" alt="AI Data Centers Image">
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming every aspect of our lives at an unprecedented pace. From healthcare to finance, entertainment to education, AI demand is exploding. But this rapid growth creates a new challenge: data centers—the backbone of our digital world—are struggling to keep up.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI demand is exploding:</strong> Businesses and consumers alike are driving a surge in compute needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud use is growing:</strong> Essential for work, play, and everything in between.</li>
      <li><strong>Data centers are racing to keep up:</strong> Capacity isn’t scaling fast enough.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>McKinsey says we need to <strong>double data center capacity in a quarter of the time</strong> it took to build everything so far—an unprecedented construction boom.</p>
    <h4>Who’s Leading the Charge?</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft investing $80 billion in AI infrastructure</li>
      <li>Google partnering for carbon-aware data centers</li>
      <li>Oracle using nuclear power for a gigawatt-scale facility</li>
      <li>Meta with 1.3 million GPUs and huge new builds</li>
      <li>AWS expanding in Georgia with $11 billion investment</li>
      <li>And many more: CyrusOne, Equinix, Digital Realty, IBM Cloud, EDGNEX, China Telecom</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This isn’t just about “servers in sheds.” It’s about data capacity, power delivery, sustainability, and speed of deployment. By 2030, McKinsey expects $6.7 trillion in new data center investment—70% of it AI-driven. The future of AI depends on solving these challenges now.</p>
