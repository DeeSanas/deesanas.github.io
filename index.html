    <h2>Blog Post: Cisco ACI Data Center Design</h2>
    <img src="images/aci-diagram.png" alt="Cisco ACI Diagram">
    <h3>The Core – Cisco ACI Fabric</h3>
    <p>At the center of this topology lies the Cisco ACI fabric, formed by a spine-leaf architecture. Two Nexus 9332C switches serve as spine switches, and two Nexus 9336-FX2 switches act as leaf switches. These switches are interconnected using high-speed 40GbE links, forming a non-blocking, low-latency fabric. All the data center devices connect only to the leaf layer—never to the spine directly—ensuring a scalable, predictable, and programmable network. This ACI fabric acts as the communication backbone, ensuring rapid and secure traffic flow between compute, storage, and external domains.</p>

    <h3>Policy Control – ACI APIC Cluster</h3>
    <p>On the left side of the diagram, a cluster of three APICs (Application Policy Infrastructure Controllers) is shown. These are the brains of the ACI fabric, connecting directly to the leaf switches. The APICs push policies, manage configuration, monitor performance, and enforce security across the entire infrastructure. Instead of manually configuring VLANs, routing, and ACLs on each switch, the APICs deliver an application-centric model, which dramatically simplifies network operations.</p>

    <h3>External Connectivity – Management and Outside Networks</h3>
    <p>In the lower-left section, there’s a Management Switch connected to the ACI leaf switches using vPC (Virtual Port Channel) links. This switch links the ACI domain to outside networks, which could include the internet, corporate WAN, or legacy systems. The use of a Layer 2 Bridged Domain enables seamless extension of VLANs, which is helpful when migrating or interconnecting legacy SAP environments. This external connectivity ensures north-south traffic flow is handled securely and efficiently.</p>

    <h3>Compute Domain – Cisco UCS with Fabric Interconnects</h3>
    <p>At the bottom-center, the design shows a Cisco UCS 6454 Fabric Interconnect (FI) pair. These FIs connect northbound to the ACI leaf switches using 40GbE links and southbound to the compute nodes using x25GbE connections. This structure forms the Compute Domain, where SAP application servers and SAP HANA database servers reside. By integrating UCS with ACI, you get end-to-end automation, server policy management, and fabric-based failover, which reduces complexity and increases agility. It also ensures that compute resources are automatically segmented and protected, following ACI policies.</p>

    <h3>Storage Domain – NetApp AFF A300</h3>
    <p>On the right side, the NetApp AFF A300 storage system is connected directly to the ACI leaf switches using 40GbE Port-Channels. This represents the Storage Domain, which provides fast, low-latency access to data using NFS, iSCSI, or Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE). By connecting storage into the ACI fabric, this design allows you to apply the same security and QoS policies to storage traffic, ensuring consistent application performance and protection.</p>
