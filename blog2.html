      <p>AI demand is outpacing data center capacity and sustainability. The exponential growth of AI workloads is driving enormous demand for GPUs, high-density compute, and power-hungry infrastructure. Companies are scrambling to secure space, power, and cooling, straining the traditional data center ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Investors are pouring billions into next-generation data centers that can handle AI clusters. Hyperscalers and colocation providers are redesigning facilities to deliver higher power densities and advanced liquid cooling. This shift is challenging sustainability goals, as the energy intensity of AI threatens to increase overall data center carbon footprints.</p>

      <p>At the same time, AI companies are investing in renewable energy, efficiency optimizations, and regional diversification to meet demand responsibly. The race is global, with the US, Europe, and Asia all competing to build out the next wave of AI-ready infrastructure while managing grid capacity and environmental impacts.</p>
