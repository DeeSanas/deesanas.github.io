    <h1>Primary AWS Services</h1>
    <div class="author">By Dee Sanas</div>
    <p>This post covers primary AWS services (EC2, S3, EBS, EFS, RDS, VPC, ELB, Route53, IAM, and CloudWatch) along with other key services you should know about.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)</li>
      <li>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</li>
      <li>Amazon Route 53</li>
      <li>Amazon CloudWatch</li>
      <li>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IAM</h2>
    <p>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. You begin with one sign-in identity (the root user) with full access to all resources, but you should avoid using this for daily work.</p>

    <h2>Amazon EC2</h2>
    <p>Provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. Eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. Lets you launch, configure, and manage virtual servers as needed.</p>

    <h2>Amazon ECS</h2>
    <p>Highly scalable, fast container management service. Lets you run, stop, and manage containers on a cluster, with integration for AWS Fargate for serverless infrastructure or EC2 for self-managed clusters.</p>

    <h2>Amazon EKS</h2>
    <p>Managed service for running Kubernetes on AWS without the need to maintain your own control plane or nodes. Supports automated scaling and management of containerized applications.</p>

    <h2>Amazon ECR</h2>
    <p>Fully managed container image registry supporting Docker and OCI images. Integrated with IAM for secure, scalable access. Supports CLI for pushing, pulling, and managing images.</p>

    <h2>Amazon S3</h2>
    <p>Object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, availability, security, and performance. Ideal for storing any amount of data for a variety of use cases including data lakes, backup and restore, and big data analytics.</p>

    <h2>Amazon EBS</h2>
    <p>Provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances. Behaves like raw, unformatted block devices. You can attach, format, and mount them as you would a traditional disk, with persistence beyond the life of an EC2 instance.</p>

    <h2>Amazon EFS</h2>
    <p>Serverless, elastic file storage for AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. Scales automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need to provision or manage capacity.</p>

    <h2>Amazon RDS</h2>
    <p>Managed relational database service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale databases in the AWS Cloud. Supports multiple engines and automates backups, patching, and scaling.</p>

    <h2>Amazon VPC</h2>
    <p>Lets you launch AWS resources into a virtual network you've defined. Offers full control over networking configuration, including subnets, routing tables, and security settings, resembling a traditional data center network.</p>

    <h2>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</h2>
    <p>Automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses) in one or more Availability Zones. Monitors target health and routes traffic to healthy instances only.</p>

    <h2>Amazon Route 53</h2>
    <p>Highly available, scalable DNS web service that offers domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking. Helps route users to endpoints reliably and cost-effectively.</p>

    <h2>Amazon CloudWatch</h2>
    <p>Monitors AWS resources and applications in real time. Collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events. Lets you set alarms, visualize data with dashboards, and automate responses to changes in resource utilization or performance.</p>
