    <h1>Primary AWS Services</h1>

    <p>This post covers key AWS services commonly used to build scalable, reliable cloud infrastructure. Below you'll find an overview of each service with its primary purpose and benefits.</p>

    <h3>Core Services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Amazon EC2</li>
      <li>Amazon ECS</li>
      <li>Amazon EKS</li>
      <li>Amazon ECR</li>
      <li>Amazon S3</li>
      <li>Amazon EBS</li>
      <li>Amazon EFS</li>
      <li>Amazon RDS</li>
      <li>Amazon VPC</li>
      <li>Elastic Load Balancing</li>
      <li>Amazon Route 53</li>
      <li>Amazon CloudWatch</li>
      <li>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3>
    <p>IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.</p>
    <p>When you create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account (the root user). AWS strongly recommends not using the root user for everyday tasks, instead safeguarding credentials and delegating with IAM roles and policies.</p>

    <h3>Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</h3>
    <p>Provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. You can launch virtual servers as needed, configure security and networking, and manage storage. EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements, reducing the need to forecast traffic.</p>

    <h3>Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)</h3>
    <p>A highly scalable, fast container management service. Run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. ECS supports AWS Fargate (serverless infrastructure) and EC2-backed clusters for greater control.</p>

    <h3>Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)</h3>
    <p>A managed service to run Kubernetes without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own control plane or nodes. EKS automates Kubernetes deployment, scaling, and management for containerized applications.</p>

    <h3>Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)</h3>
    <p>Secure, scalable, reliable registry for container images. Supports private repositories with IAM-based permissions. Push, pull, and manage Docker and OCI-compatible images with your preferred CLI.</p>

    <h3>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)</h3>
    <p>Object storage with industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Store and protect any amount of data for data lakes, websites, mobile apps, backup, archive, and analytics.</p>

    <h3>Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)</h3>
    <p>Provides block-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes act like raw, unformatted block devices. They persist independently from the life of an instance and can be resized and reconfigured.</p>

    <h3>Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)</h3>
    <p>Simple, serverless, elastic file storage that scales automatically as you add or remove files. Built to support AWS services and on-premises resources with a straightforward web interface for management.</p>

    <h3>Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)</h3>
    <p>Makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in AWS. Offers cost-efficient, resizable capacity while managing database administration tasks such as backups, patching, and monitoring.</p>

    <h3>Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</h3>
    <p>Enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a defined virtual network. Offers full control over IP addressing, subnets, route tables, and network gateways.</p>

    <h3>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</h3>
    <p>Automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets like EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses in one or more Availability Zones. Monitors health and routes traffic only to healthy targets.</p>

    <h3>Amazon Route 53</h3>
    <p>A highly available and scalable DNS web service. Supports domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking to ensure availability and reliability for your applications.</p>

    <h3>Amazon CloudWatch</h3>
    <p>Monitors AWS resources and applications in real time. Collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events. Enables you to create alarms, visualize data with dashboards, and respond automatically to changes in resource usage.</p>

    <p>CloudWatch provides system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health to maintain high availability and reliability.</p>
