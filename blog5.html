  <h1>Delivering Technology Leadership for Cloud Transformation</h1>

  <img src="Multi-Cloud-Serverless-Framework.png" alt="Cloud Transformation Image">

  <p>
    Delivering successful cloud transformation isn't just about technology—it's about leadership, strategy, and ensuring teams have the clarity and support they need to execute. As a Solution Architect and Project Manager, my focus has always been to bridge the gap between high-level strategy and day-to-day delivery.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Areas of Leadership</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strategy and vision:</strong> Define clear goals for cloud adoption that align with organizational priorities.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Ensure stakeholders understand the value, scope, and expectations for cloud projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Team leadership:</strong> Guide cross-functional teams including engineering, security, and operations to deliver with confidence.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical design:</strong> Architect solutions that are reliable, scalable, and cost-effective while meeting compliance needs.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Build feedback loops and metrics to ensure learning and adaptation over time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    At Viettel, I led teams responsible for cloud strategy, product development, and deployment across public and private environments. This work included defining roadmaps, managing complex migrations, integrating new services, and working directly with customers to understand their challenges.
  </p>

  <p>
    My approach centers on collaboration, clear documentation, and the willingness to dive deep technically while keeping business outcomes in focus. It's about empowering teams to deliver reliably while also evolving processes to support scale and agility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether it's delivering large-scale infrastructure projects, developing new cloud services, or mentoring engineers on best practices, I believe technology leadership is about making complexity manageable—and ensuring the solutions we build truly serve the people who rely on them.
