    <h1>Primary AWS Services</h1>
    <p>
      When designing on AWS, there are core services that form the backbone of most solutions. These services enable developers, architects, and businesses to build scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud applications.
    </p>
    <h2>Key AWS Services Overview</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</li>
      <li>S3 (Simple Storage Service)</li>
      <li>EBS (Elastic Block Store)</li>
      <li>EFS (Elastic File System)</li>
      <li>RDS (Relational Database Service)</li>
      <li>VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)</li>
      <li>ELB (Elastic Load Balancing)</li>
      <li>Route 53 (DNS and Health Checking)</li>
      <li>IAM (Identity and Access Management)</li>
      <li>CloudWatch (Monitoring and Logging)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Detailed Service Descriptions</h2>
    <h3>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3>
    <p>
      IAM helps securely control access to AWS resources. Use IAM to define who is authenticated and authorized to use resources. Always avoid using the root account for daily tasks—create users with least privilege.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon EC2</h3>
    <p>
      Provides scalable compute capacity in the cloud. You can launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed, configure networking and security, and manage storage. EC2 enables scaling up or down to meet demand cost-effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon ECS & EKS</h3>
    <p>
      ECS (Elastic Container Service) is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service. EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a managed Kubernetes service simplifying deployment and management of containerized apps.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon ECR</h3>
    <p>
      Elastic Container Registry is a fully managed Docker container registry, making it easy to store, manage, and deploy container images securely and at scale.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon S3</h3>
    <p>
      Industry-leading object storage with unmatched durability, availability, and scalability. Use S3 for data lakes, backups, archives, and application data storage.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon EBS</h3>
    <p>
      Provides block-level storage volumes for EC2. Persistent and reliable, EBS volumes can be attached to instances and behave like raw, unformatted block devices.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon EFS</h3>
    <p>
      Provides simple, serverless, elastic file storage that grows and shrinks automatically as you add and remove files, eliminating the need for capacity management.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon RDS</h3>
    <p>
      Makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Supports many database engines, provides automated backups, patching, and scaling.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon VPC</h3>
    <p>
      Allows launching AWS resources into a virtual network defined by you. Resembles traditional networking but benefits from AWS's scale and flexibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)</h3>
    <p>
      Automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets in one or more Availability Zones. Ensures only healthy targets receive traffic.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon Route 53</h3>
    <p>
      Highly available and scalable DNS web service. Supports domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking to ensure reliable user access.
    </p>

    <h3>Amazon CloudWatch</h3>
    <p>
      Monitors AWS resources and applications in real time. Collects metrics, sets alarms, and enables automated responses to operational changes. Custom dashboards offer system-wide visibility.
