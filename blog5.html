    <h1>Primary AWS Services</h1>
    <p><em>Posted on DeeOps Hub</em></p>

    <p>Here’s an overview of primary AWS services (EC2, S3, EBS, EFS, RDS, VPC, ELB, Route53, IAM, and CloudWatch) along with other core offerings:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR)</li>
      <li>Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)</li>
      <li>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)</li>
      <li>Amazon Elastic Load Balancing</li>
      <li>Amazon Route 53</li>
      <li>Amazon CloudWatch</li>
      <li>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2>
    <p>IAM helps you securely control access to AWS resources. It defines who can authenticate and what they can do. When you create an AWS account, you start with a root user with complete access. It’s best to safeguard the root user and use IAM roles and users for daily tasks.</p>

    <h2>Amazon EC2</h2>
    <p>Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity. You can launch virtual servers on demand, configure networking, manage storage, and scale up or down as needed to handle traffic changes, reducing the need to forecast demand.</p>

    <h2>Amazon ECS</h2>
    <p>A highly scalable container management service to run, stop, and manage containers. ECS lets you define tasks and services, run on AWS Fargate (serverless) or on managed EC2 clusters, and manage deployments seamlessly.</p>

    <h2>Amazon EKS</h2>
    <p>Amazon EKS runs Kubernetes on AWS without managing control planes or nodes yourself. Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>

    <h2>Amazon ECR</h2>
    <p>Amazon ECR is a secure, scalable container registry. It supports private repositories with IAM permissions, CLI-based management, and integrates with Docker and OCI images for easy deployment.</p>

    <h2>Amazon S3</h2>
    <p>Amazon S3 offers industry-leading object storage. It’s designed for scalability, availability, security, and performance for use cases like data lakes, websites, mobile apps, backup, and analytics.</p>

    <h2>Amazon EBS</h2>
    <p>Amazon EBS provides block-level storage volumes for EC2 instances. Volumes behave like unformatted drives, can be mounted, and persist independently from the instance lifecycle. You can resize or reconfigure them on the fly.</p>

    <h2>Amazon EFS</h2>
    <p>Amazon EFS is a serverless, elastic file system that grows and shrinks automatically as you add or remove files. It supports AWS services and on-premises resources, eliminating the need for capacity planning.</p>

    <h2>Amazon RDS</h2>
    <p>Amazon RDS simplifies setting up, operating, and scaling relational databases in the cloud. It offers resizable capacity and automates administration tasks like backups, patching, and replication.</p>

    <h2>Amazon VPC</h2>
    <p>Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated virtual network where you can launch AWS resources. It’s similar to traditional networks with AWS scalability and flexibility.</p>

    <h2>Elastic Load Balancing</h2>
    <p>Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses) in one or more Availability Zones. It automatically routes traffic only to healthy targets.</p>

    <h2>Amazon Route 53</h2>
    <p>A highly available, scalable DNS web service. It supports domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking to ensure your application stays available.</p>

    <h2>Amazon CloudWatch</h2>
    <p>CloudWatch monitors AWS resources and applications in real time. It collects metrics, logs, and events, and lets you create alarms to trigger actions automatically based on thresholds. It offers system-wide visibility into resource utilization and application performance.</p>
