        <p>Amazon Web Services offers a vast set of cloud tools and services. Here are some of the primary AWS services every architect and developer should know:</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):</strong> Scalable virtual servers in the cloud. Quickly deploy and manage instances as needed without upfront hardware investments.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service):</strong> Highly scalable container management. Define tasks and run them on AWS-managed infrastructure (including serverless via Fargate or EC2 clusters).</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service):</strong> Fully managed Kubernetes for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using standard Kubernetes tools.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry):</strong> Secure, scalable container image storage. Manage Docker images and OCI artifacts with integration to IAM permissions.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):</strong> Highly scalable object storage. Store, secure, and retrieve data for websites, apps, backups, analytics, and more.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store):</strong> Block-level storage volumes for EC2. Attach, detach, resize, and manage durable storage for your virtual machines.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon EFS (Elastic File System):</strong> Serverless, elastic file storage. Grows and shrinks automatically as you add or remove files, designed for seamless scaling.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):</strong> Managed relational databases supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and more. Handles backups, patching, and scaling automatically.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):</strong> Define your own isolated virtual network in AWS. Control IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways to securely deploy resources.</p>

        <p><strong>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):</strong> Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets (EC2, containers, IPs). Automatically routes only to healthy targets to ensure high availability.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon Route 53:</strong> Highly available DNS service. Register domains, route traffic, and perform health checks to ensure users can reliably access your applications.</p>

        <p><strong>Amazon CloudWatch:</strong> Monitoring and observability for AWS resources and applications. Track metrics, set alarms, visualize logs, and automate responses to performance changes.</p>

        <p><strong>AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM):</strong> Securely control access to AWS services. Create users, roles, and policies to manage permissions in a fine-grained, auditable way. Protect root account access and follow best practices for least privilege.</p>

        <p>Together, these services form the foundation of AWS architecture, enabling scalable, reliable, and secure applications in the cloud. Mastering them is essential for any modern cloud deployment strategy.</p>
