  <h1>Driving Cloud Product Strategy and Development</h1>

  <img src="ai-data-center-boom.png" alt="Cloud Product Strategy Image">

  <p>
    Effective cloud product management is more than shipping features—it's about deeply understanding customer needs, defining clear roadmaps, and ensuring delivery aligns with business strategy. In my role leading Viettel’s Cloud Transformation and Product Management team, I focused on driving this alignment between technology vision and real-world delivery.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Areas of Focus</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Define product strategy and vision:</strong> Develop roadmaps and feature sets that serve enterprise customers and internal goals.</li>
    <li><strong>Manage the full lifecycle:</strong> Oversee existing services while developing new offerings for both public and private cloud platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Drive adoption:</strong> Educate customers, engage engineering teams, and reduce barriers to using IaaS and PaaS services.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrate new technologies:</strong> Identify emerging trends, evaluate new solutions, and plan integration to stay ahead of the market.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-team collaboration:</strong> Work with sales, architects, engineering, and leadership to ensure products deliver value and are built for scale.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This approach required not just technical expertise but strong communication, market understanding, and the ability to align diverse teams around shared goals. Whether it was designing new managed services, defining pricing models, or engaging with customers to refine features, the goal was always to ensure Viettel’s cloud services were compelling, scalable, and tailored for enterprise needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good product management is about building services that people actually want to use—and making sure they can use them successfully at scale.
