    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m a Solution Architect and Project Manager with over a decade of experience designing, deploying, and managing scalable, secure technology systems across cloud platforms, enterprise networks, and automation frameworks. My work spans public, private, and hybrid environments—integrating AWS, Azure, Viettel Cloud, and custom solutions to deliver high-availability systems that meet demanding operational requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout my career, I’ve focused on delivering <strong>practical, reliable solutions</strong> that solve real business problems. I believe technology should be an enabler, not a complication. That’s why I prioritize <strong>clear strategy, collaborative planning, and disciplined execution</strong> to ensure every project delivers measurable value—whether modernizing infrastructure, improving security, or scaling services for growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I specialize in <strong>building cloud strategies and product roadmaps</strong> aligned with business goals, defining technical vision, and leading cross-functional teams through complex projects. At Viettel Cloud, I have helped shape the service portfolio, define hybrid cloud strategy, and deliver enterprise-grade solutions that balance innovation with operational stability.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience includes <strong>working with telecom providers and large enterprise clients across Southeast Asia and Africa</strong>, managing projects from planning through to delivery with a strong commitment to quality, uptime, and cost efficiency. I also believe in <strong>mentoring engineers, fostering partnerships, and ensuring knowledge is shared across teams</strong> to build sustainable, high-performing technology organizations.
